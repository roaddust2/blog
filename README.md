My static [blog](https://roaddust2.tatar/) on Hugo generator.  
It contains instructions, configurations, server setups, other development resources and some of my thoughts. Instead of relying on memory, Iâ€™ve documented everything there for easy reference. Feel free to explore; you might discover something helpful. Or not.
